# GUVI_REDBUS_PROJECT
Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit.
This project automates the extraction of real-time bus route data from Redbus.in using Selenium WebDriver and visualises it using an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit. It simulates a real-world travel aggregator use case, capturing live bus details such as price, timing, seat availability, and ratings.
